Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past. Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.
Exploring such planet would how much interesting! The goal of the Mars Exploration Program is to explore Mars and to provide a continuous flow of scientific information and discovery through a carefully selected series of robotic orbiters, landers and mobile laboratories interconnected by a high-bandwidth Mars/Earth communications network.
The group of enthusiastic students at IIT Guwahati aimed to make a such Mars Rover, giving birth to idea of YUVAAN IITG- The Mars Rover of IIT Guwahati
